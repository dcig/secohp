What is seco?

Seco (short for Sugar-Ecosystem, pronounced like eco) is an app that analyzes how factors like stress, sleep and the environment affect you blood sugar. Your body is an ecosystem (like a rainforest). So, to effectively manage your blood sugar, you have to understand how it relates to everything else.
